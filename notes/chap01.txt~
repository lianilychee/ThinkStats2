Study design: what's the difference between:

1) Observational vs. experimental

Observational: just observing; no treatment.  Experimental: controlled; think "intervention," i.e. giving a group a drug vs a control.

Same as anecdotal versus experimental.  The former is based on "as-it-happens" incidents, and in conversation, are more likely to yield similar responses.  Experimentally obtained data is obtained under very tightly controlled environments to prevent the biases of anecdotal evidence.

2) Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal

The former captures information about a certain group of people at a certain point in time.  The latter follows a group of people over a period of time - think a series of cross-sectionals.

3) Representative vs. oversampled

Cross-sectional studies are meant to be representative, meaning every member of the target population has an equal chance of participating.  Oversampling, however, occurs when the target population is sampled at a higher-than-real-life rate.  Example: Olin's diversity in student body study focuses on 10 Asians and 10 whites (50:50), while only 20% of Olin's student body is Asian.

4) Raw data vs. recodes

Recodes are variables calculated from raw data.

5) What's an example of something you might do during data cleaning?

Data cleaning involves checking for errors, dealing with special values, converting data into different formats, and performing calculations.

6) What's an example of something you might do during data validation?

Data validation - one option: computing basic stats and comparing with published results.  This will expose any computation / interpretation errors.
