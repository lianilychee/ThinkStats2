a) What are the attributes of a Cdf?

The Cdf class has these attributes:
xs, which is the sequence of values
ps, which is the sequence of probabilities
name, which is the graph label


b) What methods modify a Cdf?

Cdf can be modified with:
.Append
.Copy .CredibleInterval
.Items 
.MakePmf .Max .Mean 
.Percentile .Prob 
.Random .Render 
.Sample .Scale .Shift

Don't get confused:
.Value - returns InverseCDF
.Values - sorts the list


c) How do you iterate through the values and probabilities in a Cdf?




d) How do you iterate through the values and frequencies in a Hist?

e) What methods modify Pmfs and Hists?
